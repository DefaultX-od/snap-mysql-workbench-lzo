# MySQL Workbench in snap

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/tonybolzan/snap-mysql-workbench.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/tonybolzan/snap-mysql-workbench)

A wrapper for deb package `mysql-workbench-community` from original mysql repository `repo.mysql.com`.

Official packages from [mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) tend to take a long time to come out on 
newly released operating systems or they don't even exist.

Wrapping this package in snap makes it possible to use a new or different distribution regardless of the releases from
mysql team.
